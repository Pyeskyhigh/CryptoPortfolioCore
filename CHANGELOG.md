# Daily Commit Change Log

The following content represents an overview of the commits made in a day.

____________

29 Jan 2018

I added a License today and a Code of Conduct to the project. **DACP** is now licensed under the
MIT License.

____________

30 Jan 2018

I added a hyperlink to the CCXT repo in the README file so that viewers can easily check out CCXT.

____________

31 Jan 2018

Worked on understanding NODE.js for creating a REST API. I also designed the preliminary layout
for the library.

____________

1 Feb 2018

I uploaded the preliminary layout of the library to the README.md

____________

5 Feb 2018

I pulled the app.js Kabir Nagral added.

____________

6 Feb 2018

I added changes to the README concerning Licensing, Layout, Contributing and API command details.

____________

7 Feb 2018

I created a new visualization for the layout for my API, showing the API routes available to
the user. I worked on building the framework of the API and the access points specified on the
README.

____________

10 Feb 2018

I ordered the README and added a lot of context/explanation to how the library will function. The
goal was to be as descriptive as possible.

____________

11 Feb 2018

I am making the final touches to handing it off to my partner for the week. I updated the CHANGELOG
and added issues to the repository.

____________

19 Feb 2018

Caught up with Kabir and understood the contributions he made to the library. I also laid out a
plan for how I wanted to move forward. I decided that I should deviate from an API and keep it as
downloadable files. Seeing that Kabir had issues with loading transactions, I decided to work with
balances in general, and once that is done well, I will move on to building a transaction dataset.

____________

20 Feb 2018

I reorganized the repository by cutting out the routes, and all API aspects of the library. I
created balanceDataset.js and tested the CCXT functions that I will be working with. I created the findBalance(), findHoldings() functions.

____________

21 Feb 2018

I tested the functions made a day prior with the getTotalHoldings(), and getTotalBalances()
functions. This helped realize that I should also be showing the USD Value of the balance to be able
to compare and interpret.

____________

22 Feb 2018

I made the findPriceUSD() function. I am really proud of this, but still needs touch ups (as
mentioned in Todo.md).

____________

23 Feb 2018

I built the setExchangeData() and setDataset() in order to properly combine everything to output the
wanted JSON. I also cleaned up the code and organized everything to be presentable and
understandable for others to read and contribute to.

____________

24 Feb 2018

I remade the README.md to represent the new direction and goals of the library. I added pictures,
and different aspects to accommodate the explanation of how the code works.

____________

26 Feb 2018

I made the final adjustments to the repository by adding content to the Contributing, Todo,
Resources, and README files. I also added tags to the repository for it to be visible to others
looking into related topics.
