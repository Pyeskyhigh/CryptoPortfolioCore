# Contributing

  Any help offered is greatly appreciated as long as everyone agrees to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/Pyeskyhigh/DACP/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Read the following
  to understand where and how you can help.

## What can I do?

  The following three types of contributions would be really helpful for the development of DACP.

### Critiquing

  If you do not have the time to write code but would still like to contribute, commentary and
  constructive criticism is still valued. Please do not be shy to leave a comment or bring up an
  issue that you think needs to be worked on in the [issues thread](https://github.com/Pyeskyhigh/DACP/issues).   

### Testing

  If you are an investor yourself and have accounts on exchanges, try out the library! We understand
  that there are many gaps and exceptions that need to be filled so please do some testing if you
  can and share what you would like to have added or changed to the library. Share this commentary
  on the [issues thread](https://github.com/Pyeskyhigh/DACP/issues).

### Todo List

  If this project has caught your eye and you want to spend some time to help develop, please take a
  look at the [to do list](https://github.com/Pyeskyhigh/DACP/blob/master/Todo.md) to see where help
  is needed. You can also go ahead and look at the issues board as well if you feel more comfortable
  making smaller fixes that others recommend.

## Coding Conventions

  There are not many strict coding conventions at the moment for contributors to follow, although as
  the project becomes larger, there will be a stricter format. For now, all that is asked is to
  ensure that you are properly explaining the code within the file (organized comments).

## Submitting a Pull Request

  If you have decided to contribute, please submit the pull request by explaining your edits
  thoroughly. Because of the level of privacy of the information dealt with in this library, we will
  be sure to only accept pull requests with an explanation of the changes made. If we are unclear of
  any code, we will not be shy to ask you about it.
